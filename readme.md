Hello to you all, readers, here is a little summary on our side project: apt-get update developers.

The readMe document will be organised in this fashion: 

1) Introduction and Summary of the project, and the ideas behind it
2) Reverse chronologically ordered changelogs, to help you see what changed from the last version

And that's it. 

# I.) A very Smart Introduction

Well, apt-get update developers started in a train, when two people discussed about the topic of programmation language, more specifically, the difference between programming while you're in school, where you have to "learn and 'Master' a bunch of languages for 6 months" and professional careers where you will start with one language, and most likely stick to it for a really long period of time, since companies would prefer to employ a specialist in a given language for their different projects.

And the major problem with that, would be that your programming skills in other languages might deteriorate. Not to the point of becomming a complete beginner again, but you would need more time to complete even simple tasks. 

So, the idea behind apt-get update developers is to propose a weekly challenge in different languages, not something too long, since most people don't have a lot of time on their hands anyway, but something that allows them to practice, from time to time, those languages they loved learning during school, but for which they don't seem to find the time.

Our goal is to make challenges that are completable in one hour for someone who knows a little bit about the language (let's say, "I made a tutorial" or "I had a course about this"), quicker to realize for someone more skilled.

# The website functionalities will be
	proposing a new challenge every week. Challenges will remain longer than that (if possible : ad Aeternam), but we will allow people to submit the current challenge for one week.

	Once a challenge has been submitted, it will be given a note on three criterias: does it work ? have performance been taken into account? is it elegant? The elegance criteria being subjective,	we will show the challenges resulting code for a few weeks, and let people give an elegance note on each and every code.

	Allowing people to write their submission directly into a page, with a unfoldable keyboard included in the page to allow people with smartphone to complete challenges while on the throne.

	Since we want to make challenges in a wide variety of languages, we can't assure that we will have compilers or interpreters for all those languages included in the submission website. But we will do our best to allow you to test your code if you want to submit it through browser writing.

	A profile that track your progress, allowing you to see the notes you had on each challenge you submitted.

 	Maybe a messageBoard and an Inbox, if people feel like talking to each others and giving advices to each others.

	A "Best of" Section, that displays, for each challenge, the code example who got the best total score (functionality, performance, elegance), with a credit to the user that submitted it.

	We would like to be able to let people propose their own challenges, as long as they provide us a working solution. The goal won't be to allow you to make hundreds of people to do your work.
	
# Who should be interested in this website ? 
	
	Developers who want to practice a little bit of other languages than the one they spend their life on.
	People curious about new languages who want excuses to learn something new
	Students who want to perfect some of their programming skills
	People who are stuck on the same kind of problems that were tackled on a previous challenge.
